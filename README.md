\nKey Achievments:
\n•	Collected data through web scraping using Selenium and Beautiful Soup packages in Python. Scraped over 1300 articles of the Russo-Georgian war and 32000 articles of the Russo-Ukrainian war by Russian state news agency TASS.
\n•	Preprocessed articles using tokenisation to created model suitable input. Stored data in the form of Tensor datasets and then Pytorch dataloaders.
\n•	Leveraged Hugging Face’s Transformers library to fine-tune BERT, optimizing hyperparameters for enhanced model accuracy in text classification of news articles into war-intensity categories. Trained BERT on news articles from the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.
\n•	Predicted war-intensity for articles of the Russo-Ukrainian war to create a fabricated timeline for the purpose of analysing and understanding Russian war actions.
